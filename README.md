# usernamegenerator

I am in the process of creating a generic username generator, and will add more features (such as making sure that name isn't already taken) when I learn how to do so.

# Intention

This is to be made with the intention of generating a username based on the first name, middle initial, and last name of the user. It is *not* to be edited OR created by the user; as it's mainly for businesses and schools for generating an easy-to-identify username/email by just knowing their full name (with middle initial).

# Rules

If a name is not already taken, the username should be: "john.d.doe". If there is already a matching name, it should be "john.d.doe1","john.d.doe2" and so on.
