# usernamegenerator
I made a generic username generator, will add more features (such as making sure that name isn't already taken) when I learn how to do so.

# Intention

This is to be made with the intention of generating a username based on the first name, middle initial, and last name of the user.

# Rules

If a name is not already taken, the username should be: "john.d.doe". If there is already a matching name, it should be
"john.d.doe1","john.d.doe2" and so on.
